# GC Design System Icons

TO DO - intro text - something about using an icon font.
<br/>
<br/>

## Add icon fonts

To use GC Design System icons in your project, copy the icon font files in the `fonts` folder into your project's font directory. Typically, this would be `fonts/` or `assets/fonts/` depending on your project structure.
<br/>
<br/>

## Add CSS

Copy the code inside the `gcds-icons.css` file into your CSS or include the `gcds-icons.css` file itself into your project.
<br/>
<br/>

## Use an icon

To use a GC Design System icon in your project, find the icon class name from the provided example in the `examples` folder. Apply the class to any HTML element where you want the icon to appear:

`<span class="icon-name"></span>`

Note: Replace `icon-name` with the specific class name for the icon you want to use.

If you want to use the close icon, for example, you need to add the class `icon-close`:

`<span class="icon-close"></span>`
<br/>
<br/>

## Example

Open `gcds-icons-example.html` inside the `example` folder to see a list of all available GC Design System icons.
